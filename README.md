Energy Conusmption in the US Over Time

This was a project I did to try and understand energy consumption in this country. 
Graphing and extrpolating using a regression is the most commonw ay this is done,
but I figured I would try and apply some ML algorithms to it and see if anything jumps out at me.

There wasn't an abundance of data, so obviously everything should be taken with a grain of salt,
but I still found some decent takeaways.
